<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DATA MESH</code> has been a <a href="https://twitter.com/jcristharif/status/1426320304591327234">very</a> popular <a href="https://twitter.com/bernhardsson/status/1400461693197570051">punching bag</a> on Twitter lately. The volume of jokes has been matched by a <a href="https://cnr.sh/essays/what-the-heck-data-mesh">burst</a> of <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles.html">blog posts</a> <a href="https://datameshlearning.substack.com/p/okay-but-just-wtf-is-a-data-mesh">earnestly explaining</a> <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-a-data-mesh-and-how-not-to-mesh-it-up-210710bb41e0">what a Data Mesh is</a> followed by more tweets from people saying they still don‚Äôt understand. When I first heard the term and read about it, I recognized it as the framework that I‚Äôve been working in for the last 5 years.</p>

<p>Before joining Spotify in 2016, I was working on Machine Learning at Stripe, where we used <a href="https://github.com/stripe-archive/timberlake">Timberlake</a> to monitor the progress of map/reduce jobs on the Hadoop cluster. There was one Hadoop cluster which was used for all data processing tasks at the time - mostly by the data team, which included the ML group. When I arrived at Spotify I suggested we use it as well since it was so handy at Stripe. Someone from the data infrastructure group quoted this clip from the Timberlake‚Äôs README: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[Stripe's] cluster has 10-40 jobs running simultaneously and about 2,000 jobs running per day. Timberlake's performance has not been tested outside these bounds</code>. I was told it wouldn‚Äôt work because Spotify, in 2016, was often running 2,000 Hadoop jobs <em>concurrently</em>. Ignore the number of gigabytes being processed, this is a full two orders of magnitude difference in the number of <em>jobs</em> being run. And it wasn‚Äôt just one ‚Äúdata team‚Äù who was using the Hadoop cluster - it seemed like there were 100 different teams each with a couple of data engineers, all submitting <a href="github.com/twitter/scalding">Scalding</a> or <a href="https://crunch.apache.org/">Crunch</a> jobs to prepare data for whatever product they were working on.</p>

<p>Fast forward five years to 2021. Spotify has <a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/featured/spotify">migrated to Google Cloud</a> and our data processing has moved from Hadoop to <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2019/05/30/scio-0-7-a-deep-dive/">Scio</a> (our Scala DSL for Apache Beam). The number of teams doing data engineering has grown, and keeping track of all of the data that the teams make is hard.</p>
