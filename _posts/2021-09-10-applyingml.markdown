I was lucky enough to be interviewed by [Eugene Yan](https://eugeneyan.com/) for his wonderful collection of interviews and blog posts at [Applying ML](https://applyingml.com/).

My interview is [here](https://applyingml.com/mentors/adam-laiacano/), where we talk about some of the common tasks I've done as an ML Engineer, what it's like to switch to a platform team, and some ideas on how to bulid ML teams and products.

If you'd rather listen to me talk about myself than read it, [Tim Hopper](https://tdhopper.com/) and I spoke about the evolution of my career on his [Into The Hopper](https://open.spotify.com/episode/32c5iOpFgFXKey2i2HYVFa?si=c95c4f915f294175) podcast.
